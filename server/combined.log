{"level":"info","message":"Generated response:","responseText":"It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the demands of work and life. That's completely understandable – finding a healthy balance can be really challenging. I want you to know you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's great that you're reaching out for support.\n\nTo help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about what \"work-life balance\" looks like for you right now? What are some of the specific challenges you're facing? Are there particular aspects of your work or personal life that are making it difficult to find that balance?\n\nSometimes, just talking about it can help you feel a bit more grounded. We can also explore some practical strategies, like:\n\n*   **Identifying your priorities:** What truly matters to you, both at work and in your personal life?\n*   **Setting boundaries:** Learning to say \"no\" to requests that overload you and protecting your time for personal activities.\n*   **Time management techniques:** Exploring ways to use your time more efficiently.\n*   **Self-care strategies:** Incorporating activities that help you relax and recharge.\n\nWe can work together to develop a plan that fits your specific needs and helps you regain a sense of control and well-being. Remember, this is a process, and it's okay to take small steps.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, I want to check in: are you currently experiencing any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of harming yourself? If so, please know that you're not alone and there's help available. You can always reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 or text HOME to 741741 to connect with the Crisis Text Line.","timestamp":"2025-11-29T03:43:45.874Z"}
